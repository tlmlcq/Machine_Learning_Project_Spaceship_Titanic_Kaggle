# Machine Learning Project Spaceship Titanic Kaggle
As part of an academic project, with a group of 3 students, we had to create a machine learning model to predict a specific variable. This project was proposed on the Kaggle website, and the aim was to predict the number of people being transported in a spaceship using a dataset. The code we proposed enabled us to obtain an accuracy score of over 0.8, and to be ranked in the top 10% of the leadearboard.
